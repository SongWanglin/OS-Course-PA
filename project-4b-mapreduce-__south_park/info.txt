Note: 1) "make all" to build the wordcount with mapreduce, "make test-p4b" to run the program with some test input.
      I wish I could have time to write a complete test script within the given deadline, but the syntax of csh shell
      script was holding me back.
      2) I'm using the 48 hrs late credits for this project.
