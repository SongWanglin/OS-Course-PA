List of what I changed (in case I made mistakes):
syscall.h:
#define SYS_getreadcount 22

syscall.c:
extern in getreadcount(void);
[SYS_getreadcount]sys_getreadcount

usys.S:
SYSCALL(getreadcount)

user.h:
int getreadcount(void);

sysfile.c:
implementing the getreadcount syscall using global variable

Note: bochs or qemu simulators are needed if you want to run this on your home system (apt or brew to install it);
      I'm not sure if csh is needed since it works well on the GNU Bash shell on my Ubuntu machine.
