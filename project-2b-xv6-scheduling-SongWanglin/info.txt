Note: the data and graph are in the "data_graph" directory (Graph1 is 
10 points plot with 100 sleep time, and Graph2 is 100 points plot with
1 sleep time). a new user program call "graph" has been added to the
Make file.

Also, "make qemu-nox" set default CPU = 2, which will affect the accuracy
of results from graph.c (All our tests are CPU = 1 tho). So please use:

qemu-system-i386 -nographic -drive file=fs.img,index=1,media=disk,format=raw -drive file=xv6.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw -smp 1
 
instead of "make qemu-nox" to make a graph (or just change the Makefile).
