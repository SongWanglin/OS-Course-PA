Note:
 The first pzip only used one mutex lock to synchronize consumer threads. It assumes
 that we have a super large queue (never fill up) and inifite memory. What it does is 
 kinda of straightforward: one producer divide files into chunks and mmap everything, then
 multiple consumer threads to compress data in memory. Edge cases like not enough memory
 for memory mapping, queue gets filled up, are just ignored.

 For first pzip, if (chunk_size * q_size) is smaller than file size, than zip can't be 
 finished. So chunk_size >= 2MB is recommended. 
 
 Will try to use semaphore to synchronize producer and consumer threads, if I still have 
 time by Friday.
