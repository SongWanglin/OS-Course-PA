# Questions
1. Run a few randomly-generated problems with just two jobs and two queues; compute the MLFQ execution trace for each. Make your life easier by limiting the length of each job and turning off I/Os.
    - Example options `$ ./mlfq.py -j 2 -n 2 -M 0 -s 98`

2. How would you run the scheduler to reproduce each of the examples in the chapter?
    1. Figure 8.2 `./mlfq.py -l 0,200,0`
    2. Figure 8.3 `./mlfq.py -l 0,200,0:100,20,0`
    3. Figure 8.4 `./mlfq.py -l 0,200,0:0,20,1 -i 10 -S`
    4. Figure 8.5 `./mlfq.py -l 0,200,0:20,10,0:30,10,0:40,10,0:50,10,0:60,10,0:70,10,0:80,10,0:90,10,0:100,10,0:110,10,0:120,10,0:130,10,0:140,10,0:150,10,0:160,10,0:170,10,0:180,10,0:190,10,0:200,10,0:210,10,0:220,10,0`, and with boost add `-B 50`
    5. Figure 8.6 `./mlfq.py -l 0,120,0:20,100,9 -S -i 1`, and to add gaming tolerance remove the `-S` option.
    6. Figure 8.7 `./mlfq.py -l 0,100,0:0,100,0 -Q 10,20,40`

3. How would you configure the scheduler parameters to behave just like a round-robin scheduler?
    - Jobs on the same queue are time-sliced, so the answer is to only have one queue: `./mlfq.py -n 1 -M 0 -s 23 -c`

4. Craft a workload with two jobs and scheduler parameters so that one job takes advantage of the older Rules 4a and 4b (turned on with the -S flag) to game the scheduler and obtain 99% of the CPU over a particular time interval.
    - First, set the I/O time to 1 with `-i`, then ensure that CPU hog calls an I/O operation on the 99th click of a 100 click quantum length. Also, include the `-I` flag to ensure the CPU hog gets back control when the I/O request finishes:  `./mlfq.py -S -i 1 -l 0,297,99:0,60,0 -q 100 -n 3 -I -c`

5. Given a system with a quantum length of 10ms in its highest queue, how often would you have to boost jobs back to the highest priority level (with the -B flag) in order to guarantee that a single long-running (and potentially-starving) job gets at least 5% of the CPU?
    - 200. If a new 10ms-long job arrives every 10ms - like pictured in Figure 8.5 (left), boosting every 200 ticks ensures the long process will run 10/200 CPU ticks = 5%.

6. One question that arises in scheduling is which end of a queue to add a job that just finished I/O; the -I flag changes this behavior for this scheduling simulator. Play around with some workloads and see if you can see the effect of this flag.
