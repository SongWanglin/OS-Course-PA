# Questions
1. First run with the flags -n 10 -H 0 -p BEST -s 0 to generate a few random allocations and frees. Can you predict what alloc()/free() will return? Can you guess the state of the free list after each request? What do you notice about the free list over time?
    - Over time, the free list grows and becomes more fragmented. Particularly since there is no coalescing. 

```
ptr[0] = Alloc(3)  returned 1000
{ 0: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

Free(ptr[0]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

ptr[1] = Alloc(5)  returned 1003
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

Free(ptr[1]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

ptr[2] = Alloc(8)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

Free(ptr[2]) returned ?
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[3] = Alloc(8)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

Free(ptr[3]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[4] = Alloc(2)  returned 1000
{ 0: { addr: 1002, size: 1}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[5] = Alloc(7)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1002, size: 1}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1015, size: 1}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }
```

2. How are the results different when using a WORST fit policy to search the free list (-p WORST)? What changes?
    - The free list becomes longer, faster. There's less reuse of the same memory, with the strategy using up the largest chunk/s first. 

```
ptr[0] = Alloc(3)  returned 1000
{ 0: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

Free(ptr[0]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

ptr[1] = Alloc(5)  returned 1003
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

Free(ptr[1]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

ptr[2] = Alloc(8)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

Free(ptr[2]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[3] = Alloc(8)  returned 1016
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1024, size: 76} }

Free(ptr[3]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 8}, 4: { addr: 1024, size: 76} }

ptr[4] = Alloc(2)  returned 1024
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 8}, 4: { addr: 1026, size: 74} }

ptr[5] = Alloc(7)  returned 1026
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 8}, 4: { addr: 1033, size: 67} }
```

3. What about when using FIRST fit (-p FIRST)? What speeds up when you use first fit?
    - Since we don't need to traverse the entire free list on every allocation the allocation time speeds up. 

```
ptr[0] = Alloc(3)  returned 1000
{ 0: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

Free(ptr[0]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 97} }

ptr[1] = Alloc(5)  returned 1003
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

Free(ptr[1]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 92} }

ptr[2] = Alloc(8)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

Free(ptr[2]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[3] = Alloc(8)  returned 1007
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

Free(ptr[3]) returned 0
{ 0: { addr: 1000, size: 3}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[4] = Alloc(2)  returned 1000
{ 0: { addr: 1002, size: 1}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1008, size: 8}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }

ptr[5] = Alloc(7)  returned 1008
{ 0: { addr: 1002, size: 1}, 1: { addr: 1003, size: 5}, 2: { addr: 1015, size: 1}, 3: { addr: 1016, size: 84} }
```

4. For the above questions, how the list is kept ordered can affect the time it takes to find a free location for some of the policies. Use the different free list orderings (-l ADDRSORT, -l SIZESORT+, -l SIZESORT-) to see how the policies and the list orderings interact.
    - Observations
        1. First fit with `-l SIZESORT-` behaves like worst-fit, but without the full list traversal. Of course, depending on the data structure, there's some cost for sorting.

5. Coalescing of a free list can be quite important. Increase the number of random allocations (say to -n 1000). What happens to larger allocation requests over time? Run with and without coalescing (i.e., without and with the -C flag). What differences in outcome do you see? How big is the free list over time in each case? Does the ordering of the list matter in this case?
    - For best/worst-fit, the list is an order of magnitude smaller. For worst/best-fit this would have a significant improvement on allocation times. Ordering the list does still have some impact, however to a lesser extent. 
    - First-fit, ordered by size increases the size of the free-list.

6. What happens when you change the percent allocated fraction -P to higher than 50? What happens to allocations as it nears 100? What about as it nears 0?
    - At 99, the heap runs out of memory (returning -1)
    - At 1, the free-list never gets past a length of 1

7. What kind of specific requests can you make to generate a highly-fragmented free space? Use the -A flag to create fragmented free lists, and see how different policies and options change the organization of the free list.
    - `./malloc.py -n 100 -p WORST -P 60 -c`: list size 40
    - `./malloc.py -n 100 -p FIRST -l SIZESORT- -P 60 -c`: list size 33
