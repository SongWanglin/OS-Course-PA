# Questions
1. First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you run this program?
    - Segmentation fault (core dumped)
2. Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with the `-g` flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the like. Run the program under the debugger by typing `gdb null` and then, once gdb is running, typing `run`. What does gdb show you?

```sh
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000400548 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdfa8) at null.c:7
7	    printf("dereferencing a NULL pointer: %d\n", *ptr);
```

3. Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens. Run this by typing in the following: `valgrind --leak-check=yes null`. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the output from the tool?

    - Valgrind points out the invalid read:

```sh
==2430== ... 
==2430== Invalid read of size 4
==2430==    at 0x400548: main (null.c:7)
==2430==  Address 0x0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd
==2430== 
==2430== Process terminating with default action of signal 11 (SIGSEGV)
==2430==  Access not within mapped region at address 0x0
==2430==    at 0x400548: main (null.c:7)
==2430==  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack
==2430==  overflow in your program's main thread (unlikely but
==2430==  possible), you can try to increase the size of the
==2430==  main thread stack using the --main-stacksize= flag.
==2430==  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608.
==2430==  ...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

4. Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about valgrind (again with the `--leak-check=yes` flag)?
    - Memory is allocated on the heap, but not freed (a memory leak). 
    - `gdb` won't report memory leaks; that's what valgrind is for:
    
```sh
==2678== ...
==2678== HEAP SUMMARY:
==2678==     in use at exit: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==2678==   total heap usage: 1 allocs, 0 frees, 4 bytes allocated
==2678== 
==2678== 4 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==2678==    at 0x4C2AB80: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==2678==    by 0x400545: main (forgetful_alloc.c:5)
==2678== 
==2678== LEAK SUMMARY:
==2678==    definitely lost: 4 bytes in 1 blocks
==2678==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2678==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2678==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2678==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2678== ...
```

5. Write a program that creates an array of integers called `data` of size 100 using `malloc`; then, set `data[100]` to zero. What happens when you run this program? What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the program correct?
    - Interestingly, there is no error compiling or running this program, however valgrind reports an invalid write + the obvious memory leak. 

```sh
==2598== ... 
==2598== Invalid write of size 4
==2598==    at 0x400554: main (int_array.c:6)
==2598==  Address 0x51fc1d0 is 0 bytes after a block of size 400 alloc'd
==2598==    at 0x4C2AB80: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==2598==    by 0x400545: main (int_array.c:5)
==2598== 
==2598== 
==2598== HEAP SUMMARY:
==2598==     in use at exit: 400 bytes in 1 blocks
==2598==   total heap usage: 1 allocs, 0 frees, 400 bytes allocated
==2598== 
==2598== 400 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
==2598==    at 0x4C2AB80: malloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==2598==    by 0x400545: main (int_array.c:5)
==2598== 
==2598== LEAK SUMMARY:
==2598==    definitely lost: 400 bytes in 1 blocks
==2598==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2598==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2598==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2598==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2598== ...

```

6. Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array. Does the program run? What happens when you use valgrind on it?
    - Again, the program runs fine; it even prints out the correct value of the array. Valgrind picks up the issue: 

```sh
==2652== ... 
==2652== Invalid read of size 4
==2652==    at 0x4005F4: main (data_freed.c:9)
==2652==  Address 0x51fc040 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 400 free'd
==2652==    at 0x4C2BDEC: free (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==2652==    by 0x4005EF: main (data_freed.c:8)
==2652== ... 
```

7. Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the array you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to find this type of problem?
    - Compiles, but there's a runtime error. `gdb` would definitely help to debug this in a larger program. 

8. Try out some of the other interfaces to memory allocation. For example, create a simple vector-like data structure and related routines that use realloc() to manage the vector. Use an array to store the vectors elements; when a user adds an entry to the vector, use realloc() to allocate more space for it. How well does such a vector perform? How does it compare to a linked list? Use valgrind to help you find bugs.
    - See file vector.c in this directory. 

9. Spend more time and read about using gdb and valgrind. Knowing your tools is critical; spend the time and learn how to become an expert debugger in the UNIX and C environment.
